=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash - A plugin that can register stashes

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash - released December 30, 2012 as part of Dist-Zilla-Role-RegisterStash.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # in your plugin...
    with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash';

    # and elsewhere...
    $self->_register_stash('%Foo' => $stash);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes it's handy for a plugin to register a stash, and there's no easy way
to do that (without touching $self->zilla->_local_stashes or somesuch).

This role provides a _register_stash() method to your plugin, allowing you to
register stashes.  Yes, the leading underscore is intentional: the purpose of
this method is to allow the consuming plugin to register stashes, not anyone
else, so this method is private to the consumer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 _register_stash($name => $stash_instance)

Given a name and a stash instance, register it with our zilla object.
